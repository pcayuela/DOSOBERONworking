Introduction

Oberon is both a programming language and an operating environment. 
It is the final outcome of a research project whose aim was an extensible, 
highly integrated and compact operating platform for single-user personal 
workstations.

The original project was launched and carried out by N. Wirth and 
J. Gutknecht for the Ceres workstation. Now, ported versions of the 
Oberon language and system are available for numerous commercial 
machines, among them MacIntosh, IBM RS/6000, DEC station, SPARC station 
and IBM PC/386 compatibles.

Literature

The following is a family of books on Oberon. It is available 
from Addison-Wesley company:

	The Oberon System- User Guide and Programmer's Manual,
		by M. Reiser

	Programming in Oberon- Steps beyond Modula-2,
		by M. Reiser and N. Wirth

	Project Oberon- The Design of an Operating System
		and Compiler, by N. Wirth and J. Gutknecht

MS-DOS Oberon

Oberon for IBM PC/386 compatibles is called MS-DOS Oberon. Even 
though MS-DOS Oberon is highly congruent with the original system 
as described in the above listed literature, there are some 
preconditions and implementation specialties to know. The following 
sections summarize these points. They also include a summary of 
principles of operation and an installation guide.

Hardware Requirements

  1) Intel 80386DX- or 80386SX-processor
  2) 2 megabytes or more of main memory
  3) mouse with 2 or 3 buttons and driver
  4) VGA-board

Software Requirements

  1) DOS version 3.3 or 5.0 
  2) HIMEM.SYS driver for extended memory access

Principles of Operation and Installation Guide

Mode of Operation

MS-DOS Oberon principally operates in 386 protected mode in high memory 
above 1 MB. Below the 1 MB limit are video-RAM, extender, system loader, 
Oberon kernel and the procedure activation stack. The extender handles 
interrupts and DOS system calls. It also bootstraps the Oberon module 
loader and starts the Oberon system.

Restriction

No other software running in protected mode or V86 mode must be installed 
simultaneously with Oberon. This restriction applies in particular to 
SMARTDRIVE and expanded memory managers like EMM386.

File System

MS-DOS Oberon maintains a special DOS file directory called OBERON. 
It contains all Oberon files that are created at Oberon run-time. Note 
that Oberon file names may be up to 31 characters long and may contain 
an arbitrary number of part-separators ".". Oberon translates such file 
names internally into aliasing DOS file names and maintains a translation 
table.

In addition, Oberon offers commands System.CopyFromDOS and 
System.CopyToDOS, allowing file copy from arbitrary DOS directories to 
Oberon and vice versa.

Example:  System.CopyFromDOS a:/MyDir/Filename.Ext => Oberonname~

Diskettes

Data transfer from and to diskettes is supported by module Backup. Data 
on Oberon diskettes are stored in a private format that supports full 
Oberon file names. Use commands SetDriveA and SetDriveB to set the 
current drive.

Keyboard

The following table shows how to generate special characters under 
Oberon control.

	special character       key

	mark viewer             F1	(* Setup *)
	no scroll               F2	(* used in program Draw *)
	line feed               F3	(* used in program Write *)
	break                   F4	(* used in program Write *)
	shift-break             F5	(* used in program Write *)
	double s                F7
	escape                  ESC

	ae                      ctrl-a
	oe                      ctrl-o
	ue                      ctrl-u
	Ae                      F8
	Oe                      F9
	Ue                      F10

	ctrl-shift-del          ctrl-break	(* keyboard interrupt *)

If the appropriate keyboard driver is installed, ae, oe, ue, Ae, Oe, Ue and 
 double-s can also be typed directly.

Mouse

The standard Oberon user interface is based on a 3-button mouse and on the 
following interpretation of button clicks:

Primary clicks:

    left: set caret
    middle: execute
    right: select

Interclicks while selecting (holding down the right button):

   left: delete selected data 
   middle: copy selected data to caret
   left & middle: undo interclick

Alternatively, interclicking left/middle can be replaced by pressing ctrl-
key/alt-key on the keyboard. 

MS-DOS Oberon also supports a 2-button mouse. In this case, 
the left button subsumes the functions execute and set caret. To switch from
execute to set caret, keep the mouse still and the button pressed for ca. 0.5 
sec.

Printing


DOS-Oberon currently supports Postscript and HP PCL printing. To that purpose, 
four drivers are available: HP500Printer.Obj, HP500CPrinter.Obj, HP550CPrinter.Obj 
and PSPrinter.Obj. 
These drivers assume that an appropriate printer device is connected to one of 
the serial ports COM1 or COM2 with 9600 
baud for Postscript printers and 19200 baud for HP printers. If no suitable 
printer is installed, a printfile (Document.Print) is generated on the local 
disk.

In order to install your desired printer driver, simply rename the
appropriate file to Printer.Obj.

System Installation and Operation

The installation kit consists of the following files:

	name                contents

	README.TXT     this description
	SYSTEM.EXE      Oberon system in compressed form (selfextracting file)
	CHANGES.TXT    Changes since the last release

to install Oberon

	1) assert FILES = 64 in CONFIG.SYS
	2) create new directory
	3) copy SYSTEM.EXE into new directory
	4) execute SYSTEM.EXE

to load and start Oberon

	5) install mouse driver
	6) set directory containing the Oberon system to current directory
	7) execute START command

System Exit

	8) Activate command System.Quit

Note:
The OBERON directory is considered to be private to Oberon.
In particular, all files that are not accessible from Oberon are deleted at startup time!

Getting started with Oberon

The above mentioned book The Oberon System- User Guide and 
Programmer's Manual is a complete and comprehensive guide to the 
basic Oberon system. In addition, online documentation for the Write 
system and the Draw system is included in the installation kit, as 
well as some sample source code files. See Write.Tool, Draw.Tool, Paint.Tool and 
System.Tool for prepared opening commands.
